# merge_atlPR
# ===========
#
# Small script to merge an open pull request from the atl subdirectory.
#
# Pre-Requisite: have github cli installed (https://cli.github.com/)
#
# This script is intended as counterpart to the atl/request script.
# Once the opened pull request in ateles-source has been merged back,
# this script is meant to be used to close the accompanying PR that
# was created for this change.
# After the PR in mus has been closed update the repository on the
# main branch there.
# Then merge_atlPR in the ateles directory while on the branch of
# the pull request.
